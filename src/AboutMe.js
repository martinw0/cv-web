                    <p>I am very attracted to the productivity: In my opinion, it is the way of performing actions as efficiently as possible and organizing them in such a way that we achieve our goals.<br />
                    Recently, Iâ€™m interested in the organization and the personal development. These subjects are both valuable at work and for the personal life.
                    I like to believe that mindset makes my work better and more valuable.<br />

                    I like to listen the podcasts and read the website of Matthieu Desroches. He has a great experience and give very clear explanations and concrete examples.
